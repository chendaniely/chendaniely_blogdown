### Video Description

Git has emerged as the leading revision control system for open source projects. Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed. Description

Git Essentials LiveLessons teaches the skills necessary to version control with git. The first part of the course begins with the basics of Git and how to use it as an individual programmer.
