We hope this book provides a gentle introduction to data science. The main goal is to understand how to work with spreadsheet data and how data can be manipulated for multiple purposes. If nothing else, the book hopes to help you plan how to structure your own datasets for your own analysis. Even if you never go on to program on your own, understanding the way data can be manipulated and having a plan for your own dataset in the processing pipeline, will go a long ways when leaning and doing the analysis on your own, and/or working with collegues and collaborators on a project.

### Who is this book for

This book is for people who work in the biomedical sciences. This includes the clinicians (MDs, DOs, DVMs RNs, PAs, etc), researchers, programmers, and students who work with data.
