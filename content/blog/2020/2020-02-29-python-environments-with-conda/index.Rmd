[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
(and these days 
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
has been my go-to for getting Python and the scientific/data science software stack
installed on my computer
(even on my Arch linux machine!).

When it first came out it was the first time I was able to install and use
`pandas` and the rest of the scipy stack.
I've stuck with it ever since.

It was also the first time I used (and understood) virtual environments.

In this post I'm hoping to show you a quick guide to using virtual environments with `conda`.
You can find more details on how to
[manage your `conda` environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
here:

## Problem

Here are some situations virtual environments solve:

1. You have code that needs to run in a different version of python than the version you have on your computer (e.g., I have Python (3) and need to run a script in Legacy Python (2))
2. The code I want to run uses a different version of package(s) than what I have installed (e.g., you need an older or newer version of `pandas`)
3. You can't install and/or `import` a package because of package dependency conflicts
4. All the code and packages work on your computer, and you want a way to give someone else the same set of packages so they can run your code
5. You want to install an experimental package and do not want to mess up your current environment.

## What are virtual environments

A virtual environment allows you to create an isolated (i.e., virtual) "environment"
for your software, in this case, Python packages.
This allows you to "activate" different python environments on your computer
without having to uninstall everything just to run code from different projects.

## Creating conda environments

We'll be talking about `conda` environments in this post.
Depending on how you installed anaconda/miniconda/conda make sure you're in an environment
that can run `conda` commands

### Getting in the right place

You should see `(base)` in the beginning of a prompt. This is what it looks like on my computer, the `(base)` tells me I am in the "base" conda environment.

```shell
(base) $
```

You can see here the default python is the one installed in my miniconda directory.

```shell
(base) $ which python
/home/dchen/miniconda3/bin/python
```

We can run `conda info --envs` to get a list of all the environments we have

```shell
(base) $ conda info --envs
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /home/dchen/miniconda3
```

### Creating an environment

I'm currently using Python 3.

```shell
(base) $ python --version
Python 3.7.6
```

Let's create another environment named `py27` that's Legacy Python (i.e., Python 2).
We do this with the `conda create` command.
We pass in the `--name` or `-n` flag to give a name to the new environment.
We can also pass in `python=2.7` to put Python 2.7 in this environment.
Here you can specify any version of Python you want.
For example, it can be another Python 3.7 environment for another Python 3 project.

```shell
(base) $ conda create -n py27 python=2.7
```

It'll will build the plan for you, all you need to do is hit `enter` (it defaults to `y`)

```shell

Solving environment: failed with repodata from current_repodata.json, will retry with next repodata source.

When it's done you'll actually see a message on how to "activate" your new environment.

#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate py27
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

We can run `conda activate py27` to "activate" (i.e., enable) our new environment.
Do "deactivate" (i.e., exit) the environment we can use `conda deactivate`.

## Activate (i.e., "enter") the new environment

We can see our new environment when we list our `envs`

```shell
(base) $ conda info --envs
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /home/dchen/miniconda3
py27                     /home/dchen/miniconda3/envs/py27
```

To activate the `py27` environment we just created we run `conda activate py27`.

```shell
(base) $ conda activate py27
(py27) $
```

You can see when we activate the environment, we get a new prompt.
The `(base)` now changed to let us know which environment we're in, `(py27)`.

Now when we run Python commands, it's actually an entirely different Python from
what we were using before.

Here's the location of the Python binary

```shell
(py27) $ which python
/home/dchen/miniconda3/envs/py27/bin/python
```

The version is different from before
(because we used `python=2.7` when we created this `py27` environment).

```shell
(py27) $ python --version
Python 2.7.15
```

## Installing packages into environment (conda)

I'll write a separate post about setting up
[`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/) for installing packages
(the commands to run are on the website).

In general, I try to `conda install` as many packages as I can.
If the package I'm trying to install does not exist on `conda`,
then I `pip install` the package.

This is a brand new Legacy Python environment, without any packages.
In this example we'll try to install the `networkx` package.
You can see we currently do not have this package in this environment.

```shell
(py27) $ python
Python 2.7.15 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul  2 2019, 00:39:44)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import networkx as nx
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named networkx
>>> quit()
```

We can install `networkx` with `conda install networkx`.
If you need a specific version of a package, this is where you will install it.

```shell
(py27) $ conda install networkx
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /home/dchen/miniconda3/envs/py27

  added / updated specs:
    - networkx


The following packages will be downloaded:

    package                    |            build
    ---------------------------|-----------------
    networkx-2.1               |           py27_0         1.8 MB  conda-forge
    ------------------------------------------------------------
                                           Total:         1.8 MB

The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:

  decorator          conda-forge/noarch::decorator-4.4.1-py_0
  networkx           conda-forge/linux-64::networkx-2.1-py27_0


Proceed ([y]/n)?

networkx-2.1         | 1.8 MB    | ######################################################################## | 100%
Preparing transaction: done

```

Now we have the package in our environment!

```shell
(py27) $ python
Python 2.7.15 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jul  2 2019, 00:39:44)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import networkx as nx
>>> G = nx.Graph()
>>> quit()
```

Just to show that the package is in an entirely different environment,
we can `deativate` our current environment to go back into `(base)`,
and can see we don't have `networkx` installed in our `base` Python 3 environment.

```shell
(py27) $ conda deactivate
(base) $ python
Python 3.7.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Jan  7 2020, 22:33:48)
[GCC 7.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import networkx as nx
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'networkx'
>>> quit()
(base) $
```

## Reproducing and sharing environments

Now that you have all the packages you need in an environment and all your code is working,
next is to document your work.
Even if you're working on your own,
you may be working on your laptop and on a remote server,
and need to replicate your environment in both locations.
Another scenario is if you need to share your code with another person and want to make
sure your code is executed in the same environment on their machine.

We can use the `conda env export` command to generate all the packages in the current environment.
So if we're in the `py27` environment we created,
you can get a list of all the packages in it.

```shell
(py27) $ conda env export
name: py27
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - _libgcc_mutex=0.1=conda_forge
  - _openmp_mutex=4.5=0_gnu
  - ca-certificates=2019.11.28=hecc5488_0
  - certifi=2019.11.28=py27_0
  - decorator=4.4.1=py_0
  - libffi=3.2.1=he1b5a44_1006
  - libgcc-ng=9.2.0=h24d8f2e_2
  - libgomp=9.2.0=h24d8f2e_2
  - libstdcxx-ng=9.2.0=hdf63c60_2
  - ncurses=6.1=hf484d3e_1002
  - networkx=2.1=py27_0
  - openssl=1.1.1d=h516909a_0
  - pip=20.0.2=py_2
  - python=2.7.15=h5a48372_1009
  - readline=8.0=hf8c457e_0
  - setuptools=44.0.0=py27_0
  - sqlite=3.30.1=hcee41ef_0
  - tk=8.6.10=hed695b0_0
  - wheel=0.34.2=py_1
  - zlib=1.2.11=h516909a_1006
prefix: /home/dchen/miniconda3/envs/py27
```

We can export this to an `environment.yml` file so all the packages are saved and documented.
You can do this by copying and pasting the results in to a file called `environment.yml` manually,
or you can pipe the output into the file `conda env export > environment.yml`.
If your python code is in a
[project](https://daniel.rbind.io/2017/05/30/project-templates/)
[structure](https://daniel.rbind.io/2018/01/23/analysis-based-project-templates/)
you would run this command to put the `environment.yml` file in the root project directory.

Now you can send your Python project to another person or to another computer.
To reproduce the environment, you can run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
to use the `environment.yml` file to automatically recreate the environment.
The `name` field in the first line will be used as the environment name.

In this example let's edit the name to `py27copy` since we already have a `py27` environment.

Now if we run `conda env create -f environment.yml`,
it will "reinstall" all the packages needed as specified in the `environment.yml` file,
and we can activate/deactivate just like before

```shell
(py27) $ conda env create -f ~/Desktop/environment.yml
Collecting package metadata (repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done
Preparing transaction: done
Verifying transaction: done
Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate py27dup
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate

```

## Installing packages into environment (pip)

Not every package will be `conda` installable,
for those packages we can `pip install` them just like normal.
Here we'll install the `flask` package for web development into our `py27` environment.

```shell
(py27) $ pip install flask
DEPRECATION: Python 2.7 reached the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python as Python 2.7 is no longer maintained. A future version of pip will drop support for Python 2.7. More details about Python 2 support in pip, can be found at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/release-process/#python-2-support

```

Now if you want to export the enviornment to the `environment.yml`
you'll notice that `pip` will be part of the installation,
and also a new `pip` section that describes the packages that will be installed via
`pip` instead of `conda`.

```shell
(py27) $ conda env export
name: py27

  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - _libgcc_mutex=0.1=conda_forge
  - _openmp_mutex=4.5=0_gnu

## Summary

Creating environments with the
`conda create -n <name> python=<version>`
is an easy way to create new environments with a specified version of Python.
You can then `activate` the environment with
`conda activate <name>`
and proceed to install packages with
`conda install <package>` or `pip install <package`.
When you're ready to document and share your environment with another person
or on another machine,
you can run
`conda env export > environment.yml`
to save the current environment
to a `environment.yml`.
This file can be used to create a new environment with
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
and now you can replicate your environment across multiple machines!

You don't need to use `conda` to create your Python environments.
If you're not using `conda` for your environments,
you can create a `requirements.txt` file
instead of an `environment.yml` with
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
and install everything into the current environment with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Just know you need to create the environment first as `pip` will
not create the environment for you.

Hope this helps people get started with environments and getting their code working
on multiple computers.
